        I'm Anthony, and I do web development. I've been working in tech for the last 10 years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Based in Totnes (south Devon), I can provide:
      <ul>
        <li> <strong>Webapps</strong>. Perhaps there is some piece of functionality you wish you had, that you know
          would be better than
          the
          current solution. With new webapps, I take a lean approach
          and
          like to focus on results first, code second - it might be cheaper to implement than you think.

            alt="Decorative generic stock image showing some code" />
        </li>
        <li> <strong>Integrations</strong> get data where it needs to be, and trigger
          events.
          Perhaps
          you want to acquire some ability that an external company provides. This is an area where solid coding is
          required. Unit, integration and performance tests.
        </li>
        <li> <strong>Web APIs</strong> provide capabilities to others in an automated way. Web APIs are the standard by
          which companies
          exchange information, and you can charge for their usage. Again, an area where solid technical fundamentals
          are
          required. Add rate limiting and authentication/authorisation into the mix.
        </li>
        <li> <strong>Websites</strong>.
        </li>
        <li> <strong>Automation</strong>, to reduce manual work and speed up internal processes.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Experience</h2>
      <p>
        From 2019 - 2020, at <a href="https://www.dayoutwiththekids.co.uk/" target="_blank">Day Out With The Kids</a>,
        we migrated our platform from old system to a new modern web-stack,
        to
        enable in-house product developement. Here I learned about NodeJS, monitoring, performance tuning, and Heroku.
      </p>
      <p>
        With <a href="https://www.typeform.com/" target="_blank">Typeform</a> in Barcelona I was a web developer,
        technical product manager, and program manager as the company
        grew from 12 to 180 employees. Here
        I
        learned about the world of front-end, people management, value delivery, talking to other areas of the business,
        and scaling a company.
      </p>
      <p>
        With <a href="https://www.enlighten.co.nz/" target="_blank">Enlighten Designs</a> in New Zealand I worked with
        the farm automation and genetics industry, contributing to
        an
        effort to migrate a product to the web using a service-oriented architecture, and helped a large energy supplier
        trade their energy on the New Zealand energy market. Here I learned about distributed architectures, CI/CD, unit
        tests, and good team dynamics.
      </p>
      <p>
        These opportunities have given me a wealth of experience in coding, and a smattering of business knowledge. I
        know
        how to build things, and I have an appreciation for the wider context.


      <p>
        Overall, I'm looking to work with companies motivated to experiment, and make life easier. If this sounds
        interesting, please send me an email: <a href="mailto:hello@southdev.co"><strong>hello@southdev.co</strong></a>.
