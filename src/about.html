        I'm Anthony, and I do web development. I've been working in tech for the last 10 years. Based in Totnes (south
        Devon), I provide services UK-wide.

        <li>
          <p><strong>Webapps</strong>. Perhaps there is some piece of functionality you wish you had; something that you
            know
            would be better than
            the
            current solution. A basic webapp could be the answer.

          </p>
          <p>I like a lean approach
            and focus on results first, code second, to prove that the problem is not only worth solving, but
            being
            solved.

            <strong>Integrations</strong> get data where it needs to be, and trigger
            events.
            With integrations you can acquire some ability that an external company provides.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Web APIs</strong> provide your company's capabilities to others in an automated way. Web APIs are
            the standard by
            which companies
            exchange information, and you can charge for their usage.
          </p>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Websites</strong> showcase what your company does.</p>
        </li>

          <p><strong>Automation</strong>, to reduce manual work and speed up internal processes.</p>

        From 2019 - 2020, at <a href="https://www.dayoutwiththekids.co.uk/" target="_blank">Day Out With The Kids</a>,
        we migrated our platform from an older Umbraco-based system to a new modern web-stack,
        to
        enable in-house product developement. Here I learned about NodeJS, monitoring, performance tuning, and Heroku.

        From 2014 - 2019 I was with <a href="https://www.typeform.com/" target="_blank">Typeform</a> in Barcelona. I was
        a web developer,
        technical product manager, and program manager as the company
        grew from 12 to 180 employees. Here

        and scaling a company.

        New Zealand I worked with
        the farm automation and genetics industry, contributing to
        an
        effort to migrate a product to the web using a service-oriented architecture, and helped a large energy supplier

        tests, and good team dynamics.
