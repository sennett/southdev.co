      <p><span class="article__first-letter">H</span>ere is a personal project combining a simple genetic evolutionary
        algorithm with a physics engine. The physics
        engine is used to model a car on a track, and the algorithm then evolves a car that can complete the track. To
        start, 20 cars are generated randomly and dropped on the track. Because they are generated randomly at the
        beginning, they don't get very far at first.</p>

        To see it running, go <a href="//sennett.github.io/car">here</a> and leave it running for a bit.

      <p>Each car has a genome. Much like a (very basic) living
        creature, the genome controls how the car is built and
        behaves. When all the cars stop moving along the track, the most successful genomes (representing the cars that
        made it the furthest) are randomly mixed together. This creates 20 more genomes which are turned into cars, and
        this new generation is run in the physics engine. Grandually, with each generation, the cars get better, and
        eventually they complete the track.</p>

      <p>As "machine learning" goes, it's about as simple as you can get. There are no sensors other than the distance
        travelled by the car, there is no "brain" (no neural network) and the cars make no decisions whilst they're
        running. But it's interesting. If you remove all the wheels, the cars turn into balls that roll, or they
        become
        tall towers that fall over as far as they can. Maybe you have an idea for a game? ðŸ‘‰ hello@southdev.co</p>
