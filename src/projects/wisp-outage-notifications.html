        <p class="article__tldr">TL; DR: A proof-of-concept webapp that notifies network engineers of an outage,
          with a focus on customer communication and ease-of-use in the field.

        <p><span class="article__first-letter">T</span>ypically found in rural areas where fibre infrastructure is
          expensive to install, WISPs provide internet
          connectivity to homes and businesses, providing internet connectivty using arrays of dishes and antena as
          opposed
          to fibre-optic cable (aka "fibre" broadband).</p>

        <p class="article__aside  article__aside--left">"WISP" - Wireless Internet Service Provider</p>
        <p>Whilst making internet cheap(er) in remote locations, the over-the-air nature of the technology and reliance
          on
          solar and wind power does mean that wireless networking infrastructure requires more active management than
          its
          fibre counterpart. As with any service-oriented local business, when things do go down, proactivity is the
          answer.
          In the case of a WISP, by the time the customer is aware of the problem, engineering should already be aware,
          proactively communicating, and working on a fix.
        </p>

        <p>
          To this end, we worked together to develop a small real-time service that monitors the customer connectivity
          to
          the WISP, and sends mobile notifications to the right people so that they can dig into the problem further.
        </p>
        <p>Here's how it works. When an outage is detected, the network engineer receives a notification:</p>
        <img class="article__demo-image" src="../images/wisp-outage-notification.png" />
        <p>Tapping on the notification takes them to a page where they can find out more information. Ease of
          communication here is
          key, especially from a mobile device in the field, so we generated a ready-to-go message and
          added the capability to create an SMS, call
          the customer, or post the message to the WISP's Facebook support page. They can also click to go
          directly to the customer service status in UNMS, the network management system used by the WISP.</p>
        <img class="article__demo-image" src="../images/wisp-outage.png" />
        <p>When the service is fixed, we provide some additional information and a different template message.</p>
        <img class="article__demo-image" src="../images/wisp-recovery.png" />
        <p>And the notification is updated:</p>
        <img class="article__demo-image" src="../images/wisp-recovery-notification.png" />
        <p>
          The
          service could notify within seconds of detecting an outage. Internally, the tool was written using NodeJS
          backed
          onto Heroku and Postgres, with RxJS doing the heavy lifting. A very thin frontend consisting of an index.html
          and
          a serviceworker provided push notifications via Chrome. There was no custom hardware required.
        </p>

          Agile experiments like this are great. They cost little to get up and running, and carry no commitment if
          things
          don't work out. And if things do work well then the ROI can be many, many times the spend. If you have an idea
          for
          your business you want to try, either focussed internally or targeting the wider market, get in touch.
